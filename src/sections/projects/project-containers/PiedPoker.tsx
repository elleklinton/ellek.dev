                Enter the world of "Pied Poker," a sophisticated poker
                probability engine I meticulously crafted from scratch. Driven
                by the powerful Monte-Carlo simulation, it's not just another
                poker calculator â€” it's a game-changer. The tool delves deep,
                calculating probabilities that would traditionally be
                computationally intensive or downright impossible to derive in
                real time.
                <br />
                <br />
                Yet, with optimized hand calculations and nimble simulation
                performance, "Pied Poker" delivers these statistics at lightning
                speed, all within seconds. Beyond its capabilities, I took it a
                step further by launching the engine as a{' '}

                . Now, not only can I boast about its prowess, but developers
                and poker enthusiasts worldwide can seamlessly integrate and
                benefit from it. With over 21,000 installs, this project stands
                as a testament to the blend of my love for data, coding, and the
                intricate game of poker.
